# Random-Number-Generator-App
This was my very first Android project and a meaningful step in my journey as a developer. The Random Number Generator App is a simple yet efficient Java-based application designed to generate random numbers on demand through a clean and user-friendly interface.

Built using Java and Gradle, this project helped me understand how to integrate core Java functionalities within an Android app framework while managing dependencies and configurations through Gradle's build system.

Itâ€™s a lightweight and customizable app, ideal for anyone looking to explore the fundamentals of Java development combined with modern build tools. Working on this project gave me hands-on experience with Android development and strengthened my foundation in mobile app programming.
